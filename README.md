# Week 9 QUIZ
## Part 1 : Imaging & Coding Inspiration
**Artist** : Stefan Heyne

**Inspiration Type** : Abstract Photography / Gradient Atmosphere

I was inspired by the work of artist Stefan Heyne, whose abstract photography abandons concrete forms and focuses purely on light, shadow, and atmosphere. His images offer no recognizable objects—only soft gradients that evoke a meditative gaze into infinite space. Rather than artificial blur, the work reveals the passage of time through subtle tonal transitions. I aim to recreate this effect by animating the color gradients of my composition. Like the seasons shifting over time, my image will change color slowly, offering a temporal and emotional depth to the rotating visual form.

## Part 2 : Coding Technique Exploration
**Technique Name** : Vertical Gradient using Perlin Noise

**Source**:
- [HappyCoding Tutorial](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/for-loops/vertical-gradient) – Original gradient structure  
- [OpenProcessing: Rainbow Spirals by Roni Kaufman](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2603402) – Visual inspiration for dynamic extension

This sketch builds on the vertical gradient example from HappyCoding, which uses a for loop and lerpColor() to draw smooth color transitions from top to bottom. I extended it by introducing Perlin noise to dynamically generate the top and bottom colors over time, creating a soft, breathing color animation. The addition of noise() makes the gradient shift continuously in an organic and unpredictable way. This enhanced pulsing effect better fits the concept of time-based change in my project and echoes the visual rhythm I was inspired by in Stefan Heyne’s work.
